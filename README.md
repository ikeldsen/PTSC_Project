**NOTE: We're working hard to get a new release out that includes React v16, Enzyme v3, Webpack v4, Redux v4, and more. Please bear with us while we wait for some external dependency issues to clear and can get these updates fully vetted and released. Please feel free to use the dev branch if you'd like to use upgraded features, but know that it still hasn't been released.**

## Features

<dl>
  <dt>Range Report Form</dt>
  <dd>This form will allow the range officer to enter in every person who comes to shoot to keep track of how much they shoot and if they are a member or not. This will allow them to have accurate records and to be able to predict how much inventory they go through so they can better plan for the future.</dd>

  <dt>Roster Mangement</dt>
  <dd>This will allow them to keep track of who is a member and who are the active members.</dd>

  <dt>Inventory Mangement</dt>
  <dd>This will keep track of mostly targets and shotgun shells as well as other things such as shotguns.</dd>

  <dt>Competitions</dt>
  <dd>This will show who has gone to competitions when allowing them to see active members as well as their scores and will show future students shoots they've been on in the past to plan for future shoots.</dd>

  <dt>Log of old range reports</dt>
  <dd>Will be a statistics page to show them how many targets and shells get show for example every month so they can plan for future years more accurately.</dd>

  <dt>Officer Training</dt>
  <dd>This page could serve as an initial officer training hub. It could keep current information on officer roles to allow new officers to transition much quicker.</dd>
